  Favorite Repo is made to categorize and save your favorite Github repositories and find them with ease.
</p>

## Why

Have you ever tried to found a Github project, such as a library or a component after a few months you looked into it? Right now I think most of us just save in browser favorites or filter them in stars, but this isn't very good.

This is a simple project (still in very early stage, almost no front-end development yet) where the actions are going to be: 

1. Login using your Github credentials;
2. Create groups (you will be naming the groups) of Github repositories.

## Development

Fork the project and enter this commands in your terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/favorite-repo.git
cd favorite-repo
yarn
```

This project is currently using Docker, Node.js and React and GraphQL (Apollo).

To run the project for development use the `docker-compose` is the project root.

I'm still trying to learn this kind of technology, so just try to be nice.
